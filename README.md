Secure Chunked File Sharing System
This is a full-stack MERN application that allows users to securely upload, share, and download files. Large files are split into smaller chunks and encrypted client-side using XOR encryption for enhanced security and upload reliability.

üöÄ Features
Chunk-based Uploads: Large files are split into 5MB chunks for a more reliable upload process.

Client-Side Encryption: Every chunk is encrypted in the browser using the user-provided password with XOR encryption, ensuring the original file never reaches the server.

Modern UI/UX:

Sleek dark mode theme.

Responsive design that works on both mobile and desktop.

Separate, easy-to-navigate pages for Upload and Download.

Drag-and-Drop area for file selection.

Secure Download: A valid File ID and password are required to download files. Decryption also happens entirely in the browser.

Shareable Links: A unique File ID and a shareable link are generated after every successful upload.
